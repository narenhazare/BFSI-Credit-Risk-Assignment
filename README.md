# BFSI-Credit-Risk-Assignment
In this assignment, you’ll be introduced to credit risk analytics in the context of the banking sector and model a common metric used for estimating the expected credit loss (ECL) - loss given default (LGD).
Let's hear from the SME about the various aspects of Credit Risk.
Why is Credit Risk important in a Banking System? Let's hear what the SME says about it.
ECL method is used for provisioning the capital buffer to protect banks against possible default of the customers. The ECL provisioning is a mandatory accounting principle set by the Basel III norms.
The Basel norms, also known as the Basel Accords or Basel Regulations, are a set of international regulatory standards for the banking industry. These norms were developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is an international committee of banking supervisors from around the world. The committee was formed in 1974 by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries. The history of the Basel norms can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the banking industry was facing a series of crises and failures. These crises were caused by a combination of factors, including insufficient capital and liquidity, inadequate risk management and weak supervisory oversight. In response to these crises, the Basel Committee began to develop a set of international standards for bank capital and risk management to strengthen the resilience of the global banking system and reduce the risk of bank failures.
The first Basel Accord, known as Basel I, was issued in 1988, which introduced the first set of minimum capital requirements for banks. Basel I was revised in 2004 with the introduction of Basel II, which aimed to improve the risk sensitivity of the capital requirements and provide a more sophisticated approach to calculating capital ratios. Subsequently, Basel III was introduced in 2009, with stricter rules and regulations, largely in response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing economic recession. It aimed to strengthen the resilience of the banking system against financial stress and improve the ability of banks to absorb losses.
The Basel norms are used to ensure that banks maintain sufficient levels of capital and liquidity to withstand financial shocks and reduce the risk of bank failures. The norms cover a range of areas, including minimum capital requirements, risk-weighted assets and the calculation of capital ratios. Banks are required to comply with the Basel norms to ensure the stability and resilience of the global financial system. Non-compliance with these norms can result in regulatory penalties and other consequences for banks.
To comply with the regulatory norms, a bank needs to provision funds. Provisioning refers to the process of setting aside funds to cover potential losses from defaulted loans. Therefore, provisioning is an important part of a bank's risk management strategy. The provisioning by banks is also an important macroeconomic metric to gauge the economic conditions of a country. Banks may use several methods to calculate the amount of provisioning required, such as lifetime expected loss (LEL), stressed loss analysis (SLA), current expected credit loss (CECL) and through-the-cycle (TTC) and expected credit loss (ECL).
Expected credit loss (ECL) computation is a method used in credit risk management to determine the amount of loss a bank is expected to incur in the event a borrower defaults on their loan. Different banks may use different methodologies for calculating the expected credit loss (ECL) and provisioning. rk of a bank.
Banks are allowed to use their own methodologies and incorporate factors relevant to their specific business operations. Some banks may choose to use historical data and statistical models to estimate the components of ECL calculation, while others may rely on expert judgement. The choice of the method can vary depending on factors such as the bank's risk appetite, the nature of the loans and the available data. Additionally, some banks may include certain external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, in their calculations, while others may not. 

The formula for ECL typically used in practice is as follows:

ECL = EAD x PD x LGD

Expected credit loss = Exposure at default x Probability of Default x Loss given default]

ECLs are calculated based on the exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) for each borrower. Banks can calculate the ECL for different points in time based on their risk management strategy and regulatory requirements.

For this assignment, we will consider the latest date from which the data is available as the point in time. This means we will estimate the expected credit loss (ECL) for the borrower assuming that the borrower has defaulted at the present point in time.

The following are the detailed definitions of the various components used in the ECL calculation:

Probability of default (PD) is a measure of the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan. It is calculated based on the borrower's creditworthiness along with other factors such as their income, their timely repayments, number of loans, cheque bounces and debt-to-income ratio. The bank uses statistical models to determine the PD of a borrower based on the historical data of borrowers with similar characteristics. To understand this, consider that a bank is trying to predict the PD of a borrower. The bank has certain information about the borrower such as credit scores, average monthly balances and spending behaviour. The bank would also have the historical data of previous borrowers and whether they repaid or defaulted on their loans. Using this information, the bank can build a statistical model and predict the PD for the particular borrower based on similar borrowers on whom data is available.
The loss given default (LGD) is a measure of the amount of loss that a bank is expected to incur in the event of a default by a borrower. In a dataset containing the historical data of loans defaulted, such as the value of the collateral (if any), loan tenure, number of missed repayments, etc. the bank tries to estimate the approximate amount that it stands to lose if a borrower defaults. It might seem evident that this can be directly calculated by subtracting the collateral amount and the repayments received against the loan from the present outstanding loan amount. However, banks make collection efforts even after a borrower has defaulted. Therefore, the LGD is estimated using historical data from the default loan base using statistical methods. 
The LGD value for a loan, given its collateral and assuming that the customer has already made some repayments, is given by:
Exposure at default (EAD) is a measure of the amount of credit extended to a borrower at the time of default. The EAD is the outstanding loan amount after the repayments received until the time of default are deducted. The EAD is a term that measures the absolute amount and does not need any statistical estimation such as PD and LGD. It is simply the loan amount subtracted from the total repayments received.
It should be noted that banks are still subjected to regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. They must be able to demonstrate the appropriateness and reasonableness of their ECL estimates to their auditors and regulators.
